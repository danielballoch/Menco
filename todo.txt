* change layout from const to class? and actually incorperate into pages.
    -> comma out old work and try this
    *had trouble
* Do I need to change index page also?
 -> index page to class? class in class? go back and read over classes vs const to figure out a plan to:
    1. get display markdown content in index page 
    2. have layout component over 
    3. figure out what  data: {allMarkdownRemark: { edges } ... etc actually does and requires.
$$$ Just needed to put layout in return section.

Now:
! prioritise core fuctionalityfirst (snip cart)



* get snipcart buy working

* add cart fuctionality?

* style product tem and index page

* add styled components or chage styling to get toolbar, side drawer etc working
