Web goals for 9/04/2019
* change layout from const to class? and actually incorperate into pages.
    -> comma out old work and try this
    *had trouble
* Do I need to change index page also?
 -> index page to class? class in class? go back and read over classes vs const to figure out a plan to:
    1. get display markdown content in index page 
    2. have layout component over 
    3. figure out what  data: {allMarkdownRemark: { edges } ... etc actually does and requires.
$$$ Just needed to put layout in return section.

Now:
! prioritise core fuctionality first (snip cart)



* get snipcart buy working

* add cart fuctionality?

* style product tem and index page

* get toolbar working

* add styled components or chage styling to get toolbar, side drawer etc working

* get photos working


Web goals for 10/04/2019:
1. Learn more about snipcart and get buy button working on ecom site. est 1hr.
-> updated api key and added required id tag. Kinda working now 11:25 (only took 20m)
    *cart already in use off the bat. but need cart icon 
2. Learn about cart customization and figure out how long to implement. est 30m.
read through snipcart doc for next hour or so
->added cart icon.
->installed gatsby-plugin-snipcart
*need to figure out data-autopop*
https://docs.snipcart.com/getting-started/the-cart
then keep reading. 1:40m then I needed a break. @12:50pm

*need user login and dashboard for user to stop subscriptions (also shows them usefull info)


also today: look at marketing for freelancers and try suss business card.
-> looked at fonts and business card examples (bookmarked), still not 100%.
* Need to brainstorm and make different prototypes, try stuff out.. throw some shit, see what sticks.


Web goals for 11/04/2019:
1.figure out data-autopop from yesterday est 20m
-> items and dashboard showing twice, try delete snip in code and just use gatsby plugin.
$this worked and took 2 seconds :D customer dashboard also working now.
*number of items and total price does not load automatically on other page, come back to this.

2. read through rest of snipcart docs est 40m
-read through first section and found customisation options.. as well as case studies.
 Beautiful case studies! https://snipcart.com/custom-shopping-cart
 -> couldent help myself, I checked out case studies with rest of time.

-> everything can be edited: flexible product options, additional order info, checkout process etc
https://snipcart.com/custom-shopping-cart

Break. Yoga or have a walk. Butt exercise since sitting so long. 9:45 :D
-> put washing out, got air, now im good 10:00 
-> read rest of case study (10m)

3. Read through customization https://snipcart.com/blog/customize-snipcart-v2-shopping-cart est 20m
https://snipcart.com/blog/cart-customization-sass-bem-low-specificity
-> read but dont really understand
https://docs.snipcart.com/getting-started/customization 
this helped a lot (found after looking through other repos)
-> cloned repo but i'm losing focus. time for luch and to do something else for a bit.
11:30am





Web goals 12/04/2019   - 1:30m today, unless I do stuff after. 
**power went out. went shopping. Below is 30m work :/
1.explore customization options for snip cart.
*read docs from yesterday and try and figure it out?
*just get a small idea of what you can do and how then move to #2
-> after reading I think the way it works is I use the template to create a custom
 theme using sass and whatevers in the template.
I then use gulp to build the final file (testing & production/min).
 This saves time as compiling the sass


Web goals 13/04/2019
1. READ THIS AND IMPLEMENT 
https://snipcart.com/blog/gulp-optimize-frontend-workflow  est 30m
*This should be implemented in the snipcart themes application
2. Figure out how theme works (yesterdays research) est 30m
break.
*New snip tem is different than old guide, but I think everything is already done. (30m mark)
-> will keep going for 30m
*yep everything was done.. silly me didnt read https://docs.snipcart.com/getting-started/customization
but hey, I got there :D
*All new gulp tasks listed with descriptions and at least now I understand gulp.

How I should go about using the file?
*Use gulp watch and gulp sync. The created css (constantly being synced while edited)
will be on server and I can access it on my (now synced dev server) via normal link tag,
 or in my case the gatsby-plugin-snipcart options. 
e.g  <link href="http://localhost:3005/themes/base/snipcart.css" rel="stylesheet" />

10m to try it out :D *two terminals, shits getting fancy
I'm on a roll baby, lets put dinner on then do another half! (1:30m in?)
40m while dinners cooking to figure out.
-> browser sync working but not css.
*think I might need 3 servers up. sync, proxy and 
-> changed to 3006 vs 3005 and now it's working 
*setup is 3 terminals:
1. gulp sync --proxy http://localhost:8000/
2. gulp dev
3. gatsby develop

*Changing scss doesnt actually work even though browser refreshes and
 new css file is created (double check). 
 I think it could be because the link to the css file is in gatsby plugin meaning the server would 
 need to be restarted for the new css file to show up? 
 tomorrows work anyway. 

 14/04/2019

goal: figure out yesterdays troubles.
1. Update css and then restart server and see if change works.
2. Test css link in head (seo) instead of plugin.
*Just tested again and it worked without any changes. Maybe it was the order of starting things?
That's not a problem now, lets work on some design.
3. Create design plan for website and figure out goal for practice site?  (est 1hr)

17/04/2019
Finally doing design plan (desktop folder). Last few days I struggled to make a plan and was irrational.
->Formed importent questions for picking design elements, these should be reusable.
->Created fake menswear company, answering questions 
->Created freelance process document to solidify ideas

18/04/2019
Got up and felt great so doing some morning planning before trip.
-> finished freelance process doc (for now).
-> updated designTemplate doc (still more to add around how to pick features?)


19/04/2019
Goals: Font
->ecom designTemplate purpose sections. Then:
1.research selection and testing proccess for design features.
-> First fonts: *writing font choosing process now, almost done. 
*Finish rule 7 and reading articule. est 30m took 15
*Create process document. est 10m maybe a bit more :D
-> this actually took like an hour as I researched similar websites.
Even still I'm not 100%. It seems simple for this scenario of a profesional/classic
website, but there could be a lot more to it. 
*try it out/create template?
-templates done. Not really sure how to find right fonts still though.
like what actually signifys font personality?
fading so I'm gonna hit it tomorrow after work. font pairings. logo design.
create a index page layout? tons of shit to do.

20/04/2019
-Layout design. Learn how to wire frame and quickly create client options, mock up design etc. est 30m
-> Learnt how to use adobe xd a bit and created half a page tem. see if theres ones already made?

21/04/2019
8:20am
1.freelance plan document to figure out some realistic timelines for goals. est 30m
30 min, i'm about 1/3 through. so 1hour more?
9:00 called into work. Finish this when your back.
12:30 Back, had lunch.
1.finish freelance plan/timeline est 30m. 
-> actually finished in about 30m. Now to prioritise and timeline...
 which I guess is the same doc :/.
-> Finished.
2. Now continue with layout from yesterday, researching, learning and creating process document.
*work on templating process. ecom.
-> researched layout process and half created layout process document.
*Trello Tasks tomorrow.

22/04/2019
layout doc - menco catalog creation so I can make layout properly
-> create products/catalog and potentially find images (1hour) (color tones, products)
found color tones and created list of products (I will make it a onnit type deal, endorse and resell,
this way I can use the already made photos and still keep to brands vision.)
-> set up trello ready for tomorrow and the week ahead. 
*realisticly did fuck all today but I've got a plan and I'm excited for the productivity 
and exploration in the week ahead. I'm gonna have dinner, stop stressing out and work on 
my business card a bit, or find some popular fonts before chilling out properly.

23/04/2019
1.Layout process (Theory and documentation) est 1 hour
->Finished in an hour, actually got some good stuff done.
Rearranged content and gave myself a better understanding of how things would work. 
2.Create templates? (I think this would mean either for ecom site or just brainstorm common site
patterns/ideas I think I would see.) -kill two birds, follow process for ecom site.
->started process. Stage one kinda complete?
 looked at a bunch of websites to get inspiration, may redo some of this. quick walk then start creating.
*put washing on now: follow process.
 -> finished 2. (although would brainstorm a lot more and present more options for an actual client.)
*now quick mobile first wireframe. 
-> finished.. took about 10m extra.
*still need to do desktop design as well as all the other pages :D so yeah nah more time than I thought.
This is good though, it's definatly progress and I'm learning as I go :).
->Wrote down other pages and content on page, now I need to draft them in xd for client visual.
3-5 est 1 hour.
3. Draft catalog.
4. Draft product page.
5. about page.
-> got to here, this is more work than I thought but I think with templates and such it'll get faster.
Having a plan is definatly going to pay off anyway and this is the first draft the client would be
paying for and giving me feedback on.
Finish tomorrow? or after dinner.

24/04/2019
6. Draft register/Login page.
-> one took 20m
7. Draft account page.
8. Customer care.
finished by 10:40. Did basic prototype also. 
Need to do desktop ones now. (real quick, not much will change)
-> realised I didnt have cart or menu page so added those. Think I'm done for planning and need to
do something else.

25/04/2019
2:20 :/. 
yeah nah did fuck all. tiny start to desktop but I was being retarded.

26/04/2019
1.30m business card design because I'm inspired.
-> downloaded fonts and made quick test to get feedback on. Basically agreed but helped me rule out 
the bold which I thought looked alright.
* try the same thing with the other half, create some quotes that fit your business.
Go through design process. Create telling slogan, leave a bit of mystery still? 
2. -> desktop designs?
*Thinking about getting quick feedback on design, perhaps braking each page into sections 
e.g. homepage - blog advertising section and creating 2 or three versions, comtimplating reasons for each
could be benifitial to the owner and customer. It would bring reason and testing to the process rather
than just freeballing what looks good.
-> 2 featured products options & some homepage work. Hour down :/. lunch time. 
*unsure about how many options/drafts I should give. Will read up quickly.
-> made a little doc about design prototypes and presentation. lead me to design, psycology 
and the idea of presenting 1 idea with technical reasoning - based on business questions,
design patterns, science, psycology, theme etc etc - but have a backup or other options ready.
*you can always get feedback and change, but with multiple options it's hard to stay consistent 
and often leads to waisted time. Better to break the project down and present one solution. 
*framing your presentation also matters.
https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/the-psychology-of-choice#sm.00001wg21z3r4ge7cylxp8c9itqku 

-> too much reading not enough doing. I would have been better of picking a task and doing it.
Q : will I make rest of desktop pages or just main?

27/04/2019 - worked till 2. lunch. Lets put a hour or two in toward the dream :)
-> started template but was unsure how to go about... seems too simple.
-> researched and gather a list of fonts to try out, downloaded all.

28/04/2019
*I dont really need layout templates, these are what mock ups are for. Don't create work that doesnt
need to be done. Perhaps researching layouts and when to use what could be helpful though?
-> removed from list
->20m research
*gave me motivation but didn't really accomplish much. I should be doing the most important things to
quickly get me up and running.
1. Quickly do colour process doc and font tasks to self assure.
->font pairings half and hour done *template could be made but is not a neccesity
2. color 40m

31/05/2019
        1.create blog section -> same as products but blog posts rather than products
        what are the steps??
        -blog template, markdown pages, gatsby node,  
        https://swas.io/blog/using-multiple-queries-on-gatsbyjs-createpages-node-api/ 
        https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/ 
        -integration not quite working - query error. lunch then attack.
        https://spectrum.chat/gatsby-js/general/how-do-i-create-pages-with-multiple-templates~cd82ebe3-0d3b-4ce5-8f6a-193353d0867f
        https://desktopofsamuel.com/building-gatsby-with-multiple-post-type -this seems like me
        https://desktopofsamuel.com/gatsby-website-with-multiple-post-types -found an update on the guys blog
1/06/2019 ... probably should have been using git this whole time :|
-gon dun fucked it :(
    *specificity to paths and your own project, attention and understanding whats going on is how you worked it out with one create page, now do it with two.
https://desktopofsamuel.com/gatsby-website-with-multiple-post-types
-dont have energy for it right now, work on something else productive though.

3/06/2019 3pm: work on blog intead as I'm motivated to do this.
-didn't end up liking starter template, easier and more benificial to go from scratch?? or maybe I should try and understand :/
-ecom blog section not working, realised that I tried to implement something for a starter which was set up different than my project and the pieces wouldn't fot so to speak
-either 
1.figure out starter, then apply to own site
 or
2.go back to old method which worked and try figure out multiple create pages from a different source of info.

I think delving into advanced starter and seeing a different process could be helpful and if I can understand quickly then it will drastically 
save time vs me slowly adding one piece at a time, although I could look over some details so I need to be vigilent, look at plugin docs, etc.
attck this tomorrow or tonight? 


18/06/2019 - created blog (half way), now implement concepts learned e.g. correct two page node creation, tags etc
1. compare, strip and get ecom working. -products first
*I want to distinguish products from blog posts, so do I use all markdown remark or what?


**** https://justinformentin.com/guide-to-building-a-gatsby-site
dude seems legit, worth the read as I'm especially stuck right now.


        3. blog section:
            450px cream banner + Hero Text + h1 (sans)
            blog item template (image, h2, p, read more button)
            blog link button.
        4. Social media section (tan/red bg, hero text, image, icons, p)    



    2. Create layout for each. est 40m.
    3. Placeholder content. est 20m
    4. Images est 30m.

2. Get some feedback from josh tonight.

colour combos can be previewed easier with scss themes.






*look at white space formula (picking fonts ideas doc) and adjust layout.

The overall goal at this point is to make a beautiful, functional website while testing 
design practices and learning at the same time. 
Quickly get to the stage where I have value and can offer this to prospective clients so I can
live freely, learn and help people. Value, value, value. Give it out freely all the time.

Article on fonts while it's on my mind? #value
-recreate website around creating and showing value. Is whats valuable to me valuable to customers?
-or is this a way to create a community, gather feedback, learn enable others and create connections.
