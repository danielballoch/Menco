A modern, slim-fitting polo. We used our blended 78%, merino, 22% nylon for added durability and ease of care.

Traditionally, blended yarns are constructed by mixing fibers from two different sources and then spinning the mixed fibers. We took a different approach and spun a 17.5 micron wool core with two small nylon filaments. Customers have been raving about the durability, drape, and hand feel of this fabrication. You wonâ€™t find it anywhere else.
