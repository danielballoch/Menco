If you’re looking for a polo with beautiful drape, luxurious hand-feel, and all the benefits of 100% wool, this is the one. You’ll hardly need to wash the polo given its odor resistant nature, but when you do, we recommend gently hand washing the garment to lengthen its lifespan. Additionally, many of the merino polos on the market suffer from collars that lie flat. We designed our collar to stand more upright giving the polo a more modern look.
