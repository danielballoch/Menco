We hear you loud and clear. You want a wool tee that matches the durability and travel-worthiness of our button-downs. After spending a year in development, we selected a wool/nylon blend. Traditionally, blended yarns are constructed by mixing fibers from two different sources and then spinning the mixed fibers. We took a different approach and spun a 17.5 micron wool core with two small nylon filaments. After testing the t-shirt for more than six months, our founder can attest to the lab results of increased durability, reduced pilling, and improved shrink resistance. You wonâ€™t find this fabric anywhere else.
